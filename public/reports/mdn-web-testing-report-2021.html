          experience frustration with testing. We wanted to learn why. What we found is
          that it depends, and what it depends on is nuanced.</span></p>

      </h4>
      <p class="c5"><span>In the MDN Web DNA report for 2020, we reported the results of
          our segmentation study. One of the seven segments that emerged was
          &lsquo;Testing Technicians.&rsquo; The somewhat-whimsical names created based on
          which needs pop up as more important for each group don&rsquo;t capture all the

          Time is a Precious Resource</span></h4>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Defining a testing workflow, choosing tools, writing
          tests, and running tests are all things that take time. Many developers face
          pressure to develop and launch under tight deadlines. Testing or not testing is
          a tradeoff between the perceived value that testing adds compared to the time it
          will take to implement.</span></p>

      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">A helpful lens to view the results is through the
          four psychological states involved in progressing from incompetence to

          model in 1969. The four stages are:</span></p>

          </span><span class="c0">- understands or knows how to do something. However,

      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">This model is useful for framing how w - eb
          developers talk about their experiences with testing, though replacing

      <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Time is a compounding factor. Developers know there
          is more for them to learn when it comes to testing, what tests to run, how to
          set them up, what tools to use to aid in the process but to master those skills,
          they need the time to devote to learning. Time is hard to come by when there is

          and how to do it, which doesn&rsquo;t mean they consider testing less
          frustrating than their peers who know less about testing. Instead, they face a
          lack of time and resources, and competing priorities that prevent them from
          testing as they would in their ideal world.</span></p>

      <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Lastly, there&rsquo;s a perception that accessibility

          On the flip-side, experienced developers tend to have a better grasp of what
          works or doesn&rsquo;t work across browsers, so they will defensively code
          against those incompatibilities, making early testing across browsers less of a

            anymore...I might get the language a little bit messed up here, but the visual
            regression testing piece is something that feels like good low-hanging fruit
            for
            us. We already have Selenium. There&#39;s a little bit of questioning in my

            about tooling for it. That&#39;s always been the question. I know that there
            are
            a few tools that can do it. I feel like maybe even Puppeteer could do it back

            top
            of my head. I&#39;m the one that&#39;s writing parts of our build pipelines.
            If
            I can&#39;t get the time to research it, it just doesn&#39;t get set up.
            Although I think that it&#39;s a really good opportunity and it goes back to I
            wish I saw how other people were doing it in their Jenkins pipelines and could

            Salesforce

            It&#39;s
            very

            you
            can&#39;t

            to
            the
            production
            servers
            without

            promising
            to
            me.
            The
            idea
            to
            have
            a
            modern
            tool
            to
            test
            in
            all
            browsers,
            in

            important
            browsers
            at

            even

            it
            included
            support
            for
            mobile
            browsers.
            This
            might
            be
            a
            real
            game
            changer...I
            wish
            that
            all
            browsers
            contribute
            to
            that
            and
            implementing
            protocols
            for
            that
            because,
            once
            that&rsquo;s
            done,
            we
            would
            have
            way
            fewer
            bugs
            and
            fewer
            excuses
            to
            not
            write
            tests...I
            could
            convince
            more
            clients
            to
            invest
            time
            into
            writing
            tests
            if
            there
            were
            a
            tool
            that
            worked
            reliably
            in
            all
            major
            browsers.
            That&#39;s

            there
            is
            no
            interest,
            but
            if

            don&#39;t
            [build]
            it,
            there&#39;s
            no
            way
            that
            I&#39;m
            going
            to

            is
            frustrating
            because
            there
            are
            so
            many
            variations
            of
            browsers
            and
            operating
            systems.
            I
            mentioned
            a
            few
            times
            that
            we
            use
            BrowserStack,
            which
            we
            love
            because
            it
            gives
            us
            access
            to
            a
            bunch
            of
            devices,
            but
            we
            also
            hate
            it
            because
            they&#39;re
            virtual.
            They&#39;re
            not
            quite
            as
            fast
            and
            responsive
            as
            a
            real
            device
            might
            be.
            So
            that
            can
            be
            pretty
            frustrating.
            Sometimes
            we
            blame
            the
            tool,
            but
            also
            I
            think
            if
            we
            build
            a
            really
            complex
            JavaScript
            app
            and
            we&#39;re
            testing
            it
            on
            IE11
            on
            a
            virtualized
            system,
            IE11
            is
            slow.
            It&#39;s
            frustrating
            to
            test
            that
            because
            we&#39;ve
            probably
            written
            something
            that
            isn&#39;t
            well
            optimized
            for
            that.
            So
            that
            whole
            process
            can
            be

            &quot;the

            runs

            I

            know
            much
            about

            it&#39;s
            at
            least
            as
            likely
            that
            they&#39;ve
            expressed
            themselves
            imprecisely,
            or
            have
            a
            slight
            misconception
            on
            how
            it
            works
            based
            on
            what
            they&#39;ve
            heard
            it
            achieves,
            as
            that
            they&#39;re
            being
            technically
            accurate
            but
            about
